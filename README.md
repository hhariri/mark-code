## Mark-Code

Mark-Code is a command line application that can parse AsciiDoc (Markdown support coming) files for source code, extract the code, compile it and make sure everything works. It's main purpose is for those that 
write documentation for API's et al and it in some way helps make sure that the code in documentation is current (or at least compiles).

## TODO

* Add unit tests as adding/refactoring
* Continue code reorganisation and cleanup
* Make it independent of concept of Chapters
* Add markdown support
* Provide better command line runner

Contributions welcome.
